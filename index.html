		<p> I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/">CSE@IIT Bombay</a>, and a <a href=https://research.google/programs-and-events/phd-fellowship/>Google PhD Fellow</a>.
       I'm jointly advised by  <a href="https://abir-de.github.io/">Abir De</a> and <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen">Soumen Chakrabarti</a>. </p>


		<p>  I design machine learning methods for predictive challenges on graphs, with a focus on neural graph retrieval. This currently involves developing deep learning models for solving graph combinatorial problems,  scalable retrieval methods with trainable hashing, and ensuring interpretability through explicit alignment-driven justifications.
These techniques are applicable to multimodal retrieval involving graphs from diverse domains, such as knowledge graphs, scene graphs, social networks, and molecular graphs.</p>

  <p>My doctoral research is supported by the <a href="https://www.pmrf.in/">{Prime Minister's Research Fellowship} (2022-25)</a>,
  the <a href=https://www.qualcomm.com/research/university-relations/innovation-fellowship/2022-india>Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship (2022-24)</a>, and the 
  <a href=https://research.google/programs-and-events/phd-fellowship/>Google PhD Fellowship (2024-25)</a>.</p>
